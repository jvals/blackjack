## About
This program simulates two players (Sam and the dealer)
playing a game of blackjack. Both players draw two cards
at the start of the game. Both players know the value
of their hand at all times. Sam will draw cards from the
deck until his score is greater than or equal to 17.
After Sam is done drawing, the dealer will draw cards
until his score is greater than Sams score.
